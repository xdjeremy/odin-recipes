<h3>
  This is an easy take on mashed potatoes. The potatoes pressure cook away while
  you focus on other things. This is a basic but tasty recipe; feel free to
  update with your own ingredients. You can peel the skins if you prefer. Once
  you mash it up, you can return insert back to the pot, reattach the lid, and
  place it on the Keep Warm function until you are ready to serve.

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 ¼ pounds Yukon Gold potatoes</li>
  <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
  <li>2 cubes chicken bouillon</li>
  <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
  <li>½ cup unsalted butter, cubed</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>

<h2>Steps:</h2>

    set timer for 4 minutes on High.

    Mix potatoes and water and break up the bouillon cubes. Close and lock the
